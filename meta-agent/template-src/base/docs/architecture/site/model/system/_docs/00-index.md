# {{ project_name }} Software System

This page is the software-system level Info page.

## Scope

- overall system purpose and boundaries
- top-level structural elements (containers)
- links to deeper element documentation

## Rendering rule

- `00-index.md` is intentionally first in this element's `!docs` scope.
- In structurizr-site-generatr, the first section for an element becomes the `Info` page for that element.
- Additional pages (for example `01-system-documentation.md`) appear under `Documentation`.
