# 00-01 Documentation Structure Index

This repository uses a Johnny.Decimal-inspired naming scheme for published Structurizr docs.

## Rules

- Use `AA-BB-...` filename prefixes.
- Use `AA-00-index.md` as the index page for each area.
- Keep published pages concise and architecture-focused.
- Keep detailed implementation notes outside published `_docs/`.

## Area mapping

- `10-xx`: architecture
- `40-xx`: operations
- `50-xx`: planning
- `99-xx`: archive
