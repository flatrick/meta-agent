# Domain Glossary

`PKB/` is temporary staging only.
When terms stabilize, promote glossary entries to canonical `docs/` and keep PKB as a lightweight index.

## Staging Metadata (Required)

- `staging_status`: `staging`
- `staged_at_utc`: `{{ generated_at_utc }}`
- `last_reviewed_at_utc`: `{{ generated_at_utc }}`
- `promotion_target_path`: `docs/architecture/internal/1x/11/index.md`
- `not_promoted_reason`: `Initial glossary terms are placeholders and require project-specific definitions before promotion.`

Capture project-specific terms used in code and architecture.

| Term | Definition | C4 anchor | Evidence |
