# 00-01 Documentation Structure Index

Use Johnny.Decimal-style `AA-BB` filenames.

- `AA-00-index.md` is the index page for each workspace-level area.
- In each element `_docs/` folder, `00-index.md` should be the element Info page.
- Additional element pages should use `01-...`, `02-...` and render under the element Documentation tab.
- Keep published pages concise; keep deep notes outside published docs.
