# Architecture Alignment

`PKB/` is temporary staging only.
Promote stabilized alignment findings to canonical `docs/` locations and avoid duplicated long-form content.

## Staging Metadata (Required)

- `staging_status`: `staging`
- `staged_at_utc`: `{{ generated_at_utc }}`
- `last_reviewed_at_utc`: `{{ generated_at_utc }}`
- `promotion_target_path`: `docs/architecture/internal/1x/11/index.md`
- `not_promoted_reason`: `Initial alignment draft is a bootstrap placeholder and needs project-specific evidence before promotion.`

Use this file to compare Structurizr C4 model elements with current code.
Report mismatches first; do not silently fix model drift.

## Alignment matrix

| C4 element | Code location | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Mismatches
