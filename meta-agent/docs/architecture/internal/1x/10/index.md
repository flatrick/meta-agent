# 10 About The 1x Sub-Structure

This category is the metadata/control bucket for `1x` development knowledge.
Use it to define placement and navigation rules for `11-19`.

Do not place detailed engineering content here; put that in the target category (`11`, `12`, etc.) or in the matching cross-area bucket (for example `3x/31` for roadmap material).

## What belongs in `10`

- Scope and intent for `1x` categories.
- Local JD usage rules that apply to all `1x` content.
- Links that map readers to active `1x` categories.

## Active `1x` categories

- [11 Architecture And System Design](../11/index.md)
- [12 Engineering Governance And Tooling](../12/index.md)

## Reference

- [JD Bucket Map (1x-9x)](../../index.md#jd-bucket-map-1x-9x)
- [3x/31 Architecture Roadmap And Learnings](../../3x/31/index.md)
