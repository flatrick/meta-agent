# Entrypoints

`PKB/` is temporary staging only.
Promote stable entrypoint mappings into canonical `docs/` pages and keep short PKB pointers.

## Staging Metadata (Required)

- `staging_status`: `staging`
- `staged_at_utc`: `{{ generated_at_utc }}`
- `last_reviewed_at_utc`: `{{ generated_at_utc }}`
- `promotion_target_path`: `docs/architecture/internal/1x/11/index.md`
- `not_promoted_reason`: `Initial entrypoint inventory is template-level and must be replaced with project-specific mappings.`

Map runtime entrypoints by container.
